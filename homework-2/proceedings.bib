	abstract = {This paper describes and evaluates various general stemming approaches for the French, Portuguese (Brazilian), German and Hungarian languages. Based on the CLEF test-collections, we demonstrate that light stemmers for the French, Portuguese and Hungarian languages perform well, and reasonably well for the German language. Variations in mean average precision among the different stemming approaches are also evaluated and sometimes they are found statistically significant.},
