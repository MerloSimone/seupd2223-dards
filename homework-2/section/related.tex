This project's starting point was based on code snippets provided as part of the Search Engine course at the University of Padua. These examples initially provided some basic IR mechanics for the NIST TIPSTER corpus, which had first to be adapted to the LongEval corpus and then tweaked until reaching the results documented below.
In the process, some components that we selected for experimentation due to their relevance in our scope were adopted from past CLEF 2022 Touché projects. Additionally, some insight about synonym use was acquired from the \href{https://sease.io/our-blog}{SEASE IR blog}.
All the other parts of our work originate from ourselves, the DARDS group.


%da aggiungere:
%che ci siamo ispirati ai progetti del lab clef 2022 Touché
%poi aggiugnerei SEASE blog posts come ispirazione (dato che daniel per i sinonimi si è ispirato da li)
%poi basta nostre idee il resto
